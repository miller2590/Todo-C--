## Motivation

The primary motivation behind this project was to enhance my C++ skills while working on a small, practical application. I wanted to create a command-line to-do list manager using C++ and the standard library.

## Features

This application offers the following features:

- Display your to-do list.
- Add tasks to your to-do list.
- Delete tasks from your to-do list.
- Quit the program.

## What I Learned

During the development of this project, I solidified my understanding of basic string and vector manipulation. I also gained experience in working with loops, such as for loops and while loops. Additionally, I learned how to use the `getline` function, which allowed me to input tasks with spaces.

## How It Works

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
   ```bash
   g++ *.cpp
   ./a.out
   ```
