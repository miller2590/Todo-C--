Terminal Todo Application in C++

My motivation for this project was to practice basic C++ skills while building something fun, and somewhat useful.
This project uses the standard library of C++. 
This application will display a todo list menu.
In the menu, you will have the options to display your list, add a task, delete a task and quit the program.

What I learned:
Whille developing this project, I solidified basic string, and vector manipulaation. As well as utilizing for loops and while loops.
I learned about the getLine function which gave me the ability to add type string tasks which included spaces.
